    <h1>What to look out of before adding an Img to your HTML WebPage:</h1>
    <P><i>First</i> of all, most images are copyrighted so you should be careful not to use just any photo use online
        unless:
    <ul>
        <li>You own the image.</li>
        <li>You have received explicit, written permission from the image owner.</li>
        <li>You have ample proof that the image is, in fact, in the public domain.</li>
    </ul>
    Copyright violations are illegal and unethical. In addition, never point your src attribute at an image hosted on someone else's website that you don't have permission to link to. This is called "hotlinking". Again, stealing someone's bandwidth is illegal. It also slows down your page, leaving you with no control over whether the image is removed or replaced with something embarrassing.
    </P>
